Project name: 0XCTF25

Short description:
Build a secure, community-driven Capture-The-Flag (CTF) website where every user is a Player and may also be a Challenge Creator. Players can create challenges (with artifacts, flags, hints), publish them for others to solve, and compete on leaderboards. Theme: minimalist black + neon green with subtle neon animations.

Core idea & roles

Single role: Player.

Any Player can: register, create/edit/delete their own challenges, publish/unpublish challenges, and solve challenges created by others.

The platform still supports site moderation tools (optional) for takedown/reporting, but moderators are not a separate primary role—they’re ops-level and optional.

Required Features
Authentication & Accounts

Secure signup/login (email + password). Passwords hashed with bcrypt.

Role: Player (with ownership metadata for created challenges).

Sessions via JWT or secure cookie + refresh tokens; include CSRF protection for non-GET requests.

Player (Creator + Solver) Capabilities

Create challenge: title, category, full description (Markdown), artifacts (pcap, binaries, images), hints (tiered), difficulty, score value, canonical flag (stored hashed).

Edit/delete own challenges. Publish/unpublish visibility toggle.

Browse/search/sort challenges (category, difficulty, creator, solved/unsolved).

Submit flags; get immediate feedback. Successful solves update user score & leaderboards.

View profile: created challenges, solved list, badges, points, solve history.

Report abuse or request takedown for a challenge (flag for moderator review).

Rankings & Scoring

Points based on difficulty (configurable). Tie-breaker is earliest solve time.

Per-challenge ranking (who solved, when) and global leaderboard.

Optional dynamic scoring (points decay as more people solve) — configurable per challenge.

Anti-cheat & Robustness (must-have)

Rate-limited flag submissions per-account and per-IP (e.g., 10/min per account, 30/min per IP), with burst allowances and exponential backoff. Use Redis to track counters. Temporarily lock and notify on suspicious spikes. Log all attempts (timestamp, IP, UA, challenge id, result).

Hash flags (salt + strong hash) — never store plaintext flags.

Validate & sanitize all inputs (prevent XSS/SQLi). Use prepared statements/ORM.

Malware scan artifacts on upload (or at least quarantine + manual review before publishing if you can’t auto-scan).

Use HTTPS, CSP, HSTS, secure cookies. Optional 2FA for high-trust creator accounts.

Engagement & Fun (added)

Achievements & badges: First Blood, Speedrun, No-Hint Hero, Creator Popularity (challenge solved N times), Streaks. Pop-up animation on unlock.

Hint economy: creators may set hint cost (deduct player points to view) or penalty. Track hint usage.

Creator stats: each creator sees solves count, average solve time, ratings (optional), reports.

Post-solve options: allow solvers to leave optional short feedback/rating for challenge quality (or star rating). Moderation tools to prevent abuse.

UX / Theme (black + neon green + animations)

Black background (#000), neon green accent (#00e676 / #00FF66). Monospace headings (JetBrains Mono / Fira Code).

Subtle neon glow effects on hover, terminal-style typewriter header effect for challenge pages, toast animations for achievements (slide + neon pulse).

Accessibility: high-contrast text, ARIA labels, option to disable animations.

Tech Stack — recommended (buildable & modern)

Frontend: Next.js (React) + TailwindCSS. Use CSS variables for neon tokens.

Backend: Node.js + Express (or NestJS) — RESTful API. (Django REST as an alternative.)

Database: PostgreSQL.

Rate-limit & cache: Redis (counters, pub/sub for realtime).

File storage: Supabase Storage or AWS S3 (serve artifacts via signed URLs).

Realtime leaderboards: Socket.IO or Supabase Realtime.

Auth: NextAuth.js (Next.js) or JWT + secure cookies.

Deployment: Frontend on Vercel; backend on Render / Fly / DigitalOcean; or go full Supabase for simple ops. Use Docker for portability.

Data integrity & schema notes (brief)

Challenge table: id, creator_id, title, slug, description (md), difficulty, score, published (bool), created_at, updated_at.

Flag storage: store hash + per-challenge salt; do NOT expose salts publicly.

Submission log: user_id, challenge_id, attempt_hash, result, ip, user_agent, timestamp.

Achievements table, Hint usage logs, Reports table for takedowns.

Developer deliverables

Full-stack scaffold (Next.js frontend + Express backend) with env examples and docker-compose (web, db, redis).

Auth flow + Player profile pages.

Player challenge creation UI + publish management.

Flag submission + hashed-check logic + rate-limiter (Redis).

Leaderboards (global & per-challenge) via WebSocket updates.

Badge/achievement system + unlock animations.

Neon dark theme + CSS animations.
